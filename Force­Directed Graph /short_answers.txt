3(c):
Notice coolness difference is big.
If we want to choose more cool characters, square root scale is better. It scale down the bigger ones. 
Otherwise, linear scale is better. It remain the big difference.

4:
Both scale versions have the same nodes labeled, because coolness is fixed and scale only change the rendering strategy of nodes. 


7(b):
I changed the charge to -150 to let the nodes repel each other more when they get closed. And I change linkDistance to 80 to let nodes with relation keep from cluttering.
